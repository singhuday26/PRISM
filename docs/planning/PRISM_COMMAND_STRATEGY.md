# 🦅 PRISM Command: Product Strategy

> **Target Audience**: Health Authorities (District Health Officers, Hospital Administrators)
> **Core Value**: From "Viewing Data" to "Directing Resources".

---

## 1. The Core Problem
**Mismanagement > Lack of Data.**
Authorities usually have data (case counts), but they fail to translate it into logistics.
- "100 cases" is a statistic.
- "We need 20 beds by Tuesday" is a **command**.

**PRISM Command** bridges this gap. It is an **Operational Intelligence System**, not just a dashboard.

## 2. Job-to-be-Done (JTBD)

### The Primary Job
> **"When** I see rising case numbers,
> **I want to** know exactly how many hospital resources will be needed next week,
> **So that I can** allocate staff and beds before the crisis hits."

### The Emotional Job
> **"When** I am reporting to the Ministry,
> **I want to** show data-backed decisions,
> **So that I can** feel confident and avoid being blamed for negligence."

## 3. The "Golden Flow" (Critical User Journey)

This is the exact sequence we optimize for:

1.  **Trigger**: User gets an **Email Alert**: "High Risk Warning: Bed shortage predicted in Ward 4."
2.  **Assessment**: User opens **Command Dashboard**. Sees "Predicted Critical Bed Shortage: -15 beds" in red.
3.  **Intelligence**: User clicks "Resource Forecast". Sees the breakdown:
    - Current Capacity: 50 beds
    - Predicted Demand: 65 beds (in 5 days)
4.  **Action**: User downloads **PDF Report** ("Resource Mobilization Request") to send to central supply.
5.  **Resolution**: Resources arrive. Crisis averted.

## 4. Product Principles

1.  **Answers, Not Charts**: Don't just show a line graph. Show the *implication*.
    - *Bad*: "Cases rising 20%."
    - *Good*: "Warning: 20% Bed Shortage likely in 5 days."
2.  **Conservative Prediction**: Better to over-prepare than under-prepare. Algorithms should bias towards safety.
3.  **Speed to Insight**: detailed analysis is for researchers. Authorities need the "Headline" in 3 seconds.

## 5. Success Metrics (KPIs)

| Metric | Definition | Goal |
|--------|------------|------|
| **Actionable Alert Rate** | % of alerts that lead to a resource decision | > 40% |
| **Response Time** | Time from "Risk Signal" to "User Acknowledgement" | < 24 hours |
| **Prediction Accuracy** | Precision of Resource Demand vs Actual | +/- 15% |
